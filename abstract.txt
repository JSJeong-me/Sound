

long-range dependencies are difﬁcult to model directly in the time domain

they can be more tractably modelled in two-dimensional time-frequency representations such as spectrograms

By leveraging this representational advantage, in conjunction with a highly expressive probabilistic model and a multiscale generation procedure,

 we design a model capable of generating high-ﬁdelity audio samples which capture structure at timescales that time-domain models have yet to achieve

by density estimates and human judgments
